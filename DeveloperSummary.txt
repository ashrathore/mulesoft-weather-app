Deloitte Technical exercise developer summary.
==============================================

Disclaimer:
-----------
This is the first time I have used Mulesoft Anypoint for development. So some code or design decisions may be naive.
The intent of this exercise is to learn a new technology like MuleSoft AnyPoint and to demonstrate an integration scenario using it.
This code should not be used in production and should just be used as a reference.


Mulesoft Anypoint Setup Issues:
-------------------------------
-> Admin access for laptop.
-> Anypoint studio version 4.xx is not compatible with DataWeave v1
-> Could not enable Maven support as it requires Mulesoft Maven repo access.


Supplied webservice issues:
---------------------------
-> The SOAP webservice at URL http://www.webservicex.com/globalweather.asmx?WSDL was unavailable. Used Docker image for the service.
-> Webservice provide with the docker image embeded the content in two CDATA elements (<![CDATA[ <![CDATA[ ]] ]]) which was wrong. 
   Corrected the docker image. New docker sample is available in repo.

   
Approaches taken:
-----------------

-> REST APIs
Mapped SOAP webservices with corrsponsing REST APIs. Used RAML for defining the REST specs.

--> REST API : /countries
Used XSLT transformation to select all distinct Countries from the webservice response.

--> REST API : /countries/{country}/cities
Used Dataweave transformation to select Cities from the webservice response.
Used filter to select cities for a particular country.
Validation added for path param : country

--> REST API : /countries/{country}/cities/{city}/weather
Used Dataweave transformation to select the webservice weather response to JSON.
Used filter to select weather for a particular city.
Validation added for path param : country, city


NOTE: 
-----
--> Some endpoints like /countries/{country}, /countries/{country}/cities/{city} are left out as there was nothing unique to demonstrate here.
--> Security aspects are not included or demonstrated.
--> MIME type application/json is used to return the output.
--> Comprehensive use of HTTP status codes and headers is not demonstrated but left out for discussion.
--> Unit tests are added only for happy path scenarios.
