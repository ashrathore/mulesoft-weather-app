Deloitte Technical exercise developer summary.
==============================================

Disclaimer:
-----------
This is the first time I have used Mulesoft Anypoint for development. So some code may be naive.
Most of the issues encountered were the one point setup issues and software incompatibility issues.
Some of the features were not available in my development environment.


Mulesoft Anypoint Setup Issues:
-------------------------------
-> Admin access for laptop.
-> Anypoint studio version 4.xx is not compatible with DataWeave v1
-> Could not enable Maven for project packaging due to unavailability of JDK 1.5
-> Could not enable MUnit support due to missing Mulesoft libraries.


Supplied webservice issues:
---------------------------
-> The SOAP webservice at URL http://www.webservicex.com/globalweather.asmx?WSDL was unavailable. Used Docker image for the service.
-> Webservice provide with the docker image embeded the content in two CDATA elements (<![CDATA[ <![CDATA[ ]] ]]) which was wrong. 
   Corrected the docker image. New docker sample is available in repo.

   
Approaches taken:
-----------------

-> REST APIs
Mapped SOAP webservices with corrsponsing REST APIs. Used RAML for defining the REST specs.

--> REST API : /countries
Used XSLT transformation to select all distinct Countries from the webservice response.

--> REST API : /countries/{country}/cities
Used Dataweave transformation to select Cities from the webservice response.
Validation added for path param : country

--> REST API : /countries/{country}/cities/{city}/weather
Used Dataweave transformation to select the webservice weather response to JSON.
Validation added for path param : country, city

NOTE: 
Some endpoints like /countries/{country}, /countries/{country}/cities/{city} are left out as there was nothing unique to demonstrate here.
Security aspects are not included or demonstrated.
MIME type application/json is used to return the output.
